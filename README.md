# Capstone Project: FamTree

## Project Idea Brief

**Project Name:** FamTree

**Idea:** FamTree is a simple family tree visualization platform where users can create, update, and manage family relationships. It allows users to add family members, edit details, and share their family trees. The platform ensures secure access and smooth collaboration.

In today's fast-paced world, families are becoming more disconnected, and many members may not even know how they are related. As generations grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of family connections, shared history, and relationships. FamTree addresses this need by providing an interactive platform where users can easily visualize their family tree, strengthen bonds, and preserve their lineage for future generations. This project fosters a sense of belonging by keeping families connected, no matter how far apart they are.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Family Tree Creation** – Add and visualize relationships dynamically
- ✅ **CRUD Operations** – Users can create, read, update, and delete family members
- ✅ **User Authentication** – Secure login via JWT authentication
- ✅ **Collaborative Input** – Shareable links for family members to contribute
- ✅ **Profile Management** – Users can edit their profiles
